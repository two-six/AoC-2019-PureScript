* Day 1
State monad proved to be useful in this one. Pretty trivial.

* Day 2
A lot of array copying, should've maybe used mutable arrays there. Otherwise not that bad.
Not really needed to use Writer Monad here, but I just wanted to experiment ðŸ˜…

* Day 3
Maps and Tuples. Proved to be a little bit tricky at first.

* Day 4
Easy one, just some guards.
